I’m realizing that duplicates might exist when is_active is true, which could cause index creation to fail. So, I think it’s better not to enforce uniqueness for now. Instead, I’ll add an index on (user_id, certificate_id) to improve performance without making it unique. 

I’ll wait for the user to approve the SQL before implementing code changes. I’ll ensure to name constraints thoughtfully to avoid conflicts. The SQL will include adding foreign keys and indexes, while checking that existing data aligns with schema requirements. A view for easier retrieval might also be an option, but it isn’t necessary." duration="15.010691">

There are no triggers, but I want to ensure the RLS policy includes is_owner_by_email, which is already set up. I’ll also confirm that the 'certificates' table has a default 'is_active' and 'certificate_type=completion', as part of the edge function. 

After we prepare the SQL, my plan is to propose the necessary code changes, such as updating the hook to maintain the Supabase session, applying a fallback join, and adding a reload button for convenience. 

However, I need to remind the user to confirm running the SQL commands before proceeding, and I’ll present the “Implement the plan” quick reply along with the SQL block for review. I’ll summarize the rationale for the changes, outline the steps in the plan, and include actions related to troubleshooting, but without linking to a troubleshooting document since things aren’t in an error loop." duration="3.105445">

Thanks for the clear direction. I checked how certificates are fetched and displayed:

What’s wrong
- Timing/auth race: The Certificates tab uses the useCertificates hook, which queries user_certificates as soon as “isAuthenticated” is true (Clerk), but before the Supabase session is guaranteed to be established. Since user_certificates is protected by RLS, queries sent without a Supabase session often return 0 rows.
- Missing relationship: The query tries to embed certificates with certificates (*), but there’s no foreign key defined between user_certificates.certificate_id and certificates.id. Without a FK, Supabase can’t join/expand the related table, so the “certificates” field will be missing/empty even if rows exist.
- No refetch after session: When the Supabase session becomes ready later, the hook doesn’t refetch; so the Certificates page remains empty.

What we’ll change
- Database integrity: Add a proper foreign key from user_certificates.certificate_id -> certificates.id and add indexes for fast filtering. This enables select(..., certificates(*)) reliably.
- Reliable fetching: Update useCertificates to:
  - ensureSupabaseSession() before fetching
  - refetch after the Supabase auth state is ready
  - handle the case where join fails by falling back to fetching certificates separately (defensive).
- UX: CertificatesPage already renders a decent UI once data is available; we’ll only add a small safety in rendering if cert.certificates is undefined, so it never silently “disappears.”

lov-plan
Plan to show all issued certificates for the current user and fix the underlying issues

1) Database
- Add the missing FK: user_certificates.certificate_id -> certificates.id
- Add indexes on user_certificates.user_id and (user_id, certificate_id) to speed up the page load

2) Client fixes
- useCertificates:
  - Inject ensureSupabaseSession from useAuth and await it before queries
  - Refetch after Supabase auth is established (subscribe to onAuthStateChange or check getSession and trigger a refetch)
  - Keep the current filter .eq('user_id', getSupabaseUserId()) and return nested certificates using the FK
  - Add a resilient fallback: if the related certificates embed is absent, fetch certificate rows by IDs and merge in memory

- CertificatesPage:
  - Handle the case where cert.certificates is missing by showing the title via a fallback (e.g., “Certificate” with the verification code), so the card still appears instead of failing silently
  - Optional: add a small “Refresh” button to re-trigger the hook if needed

3) Validation
- After changes, verify:
  - issued rows exist in user_certificates for the user who passed assessment (the edge function already writes them)
  - The Certificates tab shows those rows with titles/descriptions
  - No blank state when the user revisits the tab (session already established)
</lov-plan>

Below are the safe database changes to establish the relationship and improve performance. Please review and approve them. After they’re applied, I’ll implement the client-side fixes.

<lov-sql>
-- 1) Add a foreign key from user_certificates.certificate_id to certificates.id
-- This enables embedded selects of related certificate data in Supabase
ALTER TABLE public.user_certificates
ADD CONSTRAINT user_certificates_certificate_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (certificate_id) REFERENCES public.certificates (id) ON DELETE RESTRICT;

-- 2) Add helpful indexes for faster lookups on the Certificates page
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_certificates_user_id
ON public.user_certificates (user_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_certificates_user_certificate
ON public.user_certificates (user_id, certificate_id);
